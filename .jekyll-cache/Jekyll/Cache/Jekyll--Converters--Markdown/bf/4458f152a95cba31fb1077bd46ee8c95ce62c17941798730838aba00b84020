I"ô<p>Iâ€™m 19 years old Cyber Security enthusiast from Tbilisi, Georgia. I got interested in Cyber Security at the age of 17(Won CyberCube(event in georgia) with my friend). When Iâ€™m not busy, I always attend lectures and tech talks(ippsec fan here), because I want to learn new things of all areas in technology.</p>

<p>My goal here is to keep notes on the things I enjoy and the paths that I take. To me, knowledge is important but it is only beneficial if it is organised and efficient. 
Unfortunately, when I dive deep into researching something things get a little intense. This results in a huge mess of information that ends up breeding chaos. This is my attempt to rectify that!</p>
